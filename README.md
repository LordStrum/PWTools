# Yoso's PWTools Library
This is my library of tools. I'm currently re-writing them all so not everything is quite here yet. I figured I'd make it open source to those who discover it. Feel free to use it in any project you like.

## Installation
You'll need Composer to install this package. Just run:
    
    composer require yosodog/pwtools

## Documentation
As this library isn't finished yet, there is no official documentation yet. However, everything is documented with phpdoc so if you want you can generate that and get a quick overview. The project isn't very large yet so a quick look at the code will tell you really what to do.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, fork the repo and submit a pull request. If you have ideas, DM me on Discord.
